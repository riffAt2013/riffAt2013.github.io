  <div class="details">
    I'm Rifat Masud. A fullstack web developer from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I love
    all things related to web develpment, artificial intelligence and
    programming. I'm specifically skilled in Javascript, ReactJS, NextJS,
    Firebase, GraphQL, MongoDB, Python, Django, FastAI, Pytorch. <br />
    As a student in North South University, I was a part of a Mars Rover team
    NSU Mars Ex and led the software team to automate the rover using Python and
    its variety of libraries (OpenCV, Pytorch, FastAI etc) in a Raspberry PI
    environment. I helped create the official website for the team using modern
    fullstack solutions. <br />
    Currently looking for a job, with a view to learn, grow and help building in
    world class web applications with probably a sprinkle of AI on top it 😉.
